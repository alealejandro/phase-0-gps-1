I feel that I wasn't struggling with the concepts. Rather, I struggled with putting them into practice, as I would forget which commands I needed to enter/syntax of the commands.

I learned a lot about fetching & merging in the GPS.
- The difference between fetch & merge
- Merging locally, as well as in Github

I asked my pair about mostly Git commands, as I would forget which I would need to input. My technical questions were addressed readily, whether they knew it already or researched really quickly. When I was driving, I'd check in with him to ensure that we were on the same page.
I asked my guide about Git concepts, like the ones listed above regarding fetching & merging.

I think just visualizing version control & keeping track of the different branches still confuses me, but will come with practice.

My first GPS experience was very positive. My partner Jung was calm & collected throughout the session and didn't seem to worry when hitting an obstacle. 
A few of the key takeaways from this first experience were:
- Navigator: just read directions without skipping over/synthesizing, while in tandem with the driver
- Driver: speak through your thought process as you enter commands; check in before pressing "enter"
