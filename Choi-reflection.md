## GPS 1.1 Reflection
Jung Choi   2016.08.30

- Before the GPS session I was struggling with fetching and pulling on git and also merge conflicts

- After the GPS fetching and pulling are much clearer to me.

- I asked my pair about his life and background after the GPS was over, which helped me get to know him a little better. During the GPS I would ask him questions like "What is the command for such and such or could you read the directions again." When ever both my pair and I were confused as to what happened or were stuck we would ask the guide to clarify for us.

- I am still a little bit confused about merge conflicts. We touched on it briefly during this GPS, but I feel like there is a lot more to merge conflicts, especially when we are dealing with much larger projects.

- My first experience pairing in a GPS went very well. I feel like my pair and I were on the same page and that we worked well together. It was a little confusing because it was out first paired programming session, but I feel like we caught on pretty quickly. I did realize that when it was my turn to drive that I was not communicating very well with my partner and it created some confusion.
